      <h2>Introduction</h2>




    My name is Louise Kane and I am 19 years old. I am from a small town called Gourock that is located in the West coast of Scotland. In September 2017, I moved to Aberdeen to study Cyber Security at Robert Gordon University. From the picture below, it can be seen that the distance betwewen my home town and Aberdeen is a long way. It takes nearly four hours to return to Gourock. From the map shown below, you can notice that Gourock is far away from Aberden and this is why I chose to move here as it would be way too far a distance to commute everyday.
