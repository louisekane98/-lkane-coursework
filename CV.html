  <h2><u>Work History</u></h2>
  <p>
  <h3>
  Funworld – October 2014 to September 2017
</h3>
  For the past three years, I have worked in a play centre for young children aged up until 10. This has developed my intellectual skills and the way I am as a person. I enjoy this job as I am able to take on new tasks while working with children. As a play-leader, it is my job to make sure that the children are always safe when using the equipment. I also take the role of organising children's parties and running them on the day. I love chatting to children and finding out how we can improve the company to make children feel secure and happy.

  During this time, I have also been given the opportunity to take over as a receptionist. This role has been taken on over the past two years. As a receptionist, it has given me the chance to develop a range of new skills. It has been my job to carry out tasks such as welcoming people into the building, dealing with customer complaints, booking parties cashing up and answering phone calls and emails.

  <h3>
    Enterprise Childcare – June 2017 to August 2017
  </h3>
  During the summer holidays, I managed to find a summer job working with children that have Autism. As a play work practitioner, I was a member of a team of individuals that would cater for children on the spectrum. The club brings together children and young people from across Inverclyde to spend time together in a fun and safe environment.

  <h2><u>Work Experience</u></h2>

<h3>St Ninians Primary School – August 2015 to April 2016</h3>
 <p>During my time in sixth year, I was able to find myself a work placement in a local primary
school. I worked alongside the teacher and helped her with her lessons. The class that I
worked with were very welcoming and were pleased to see me every time that I went to help.
I enjoyed this placement as I got to work with a range of children.</p>
 
 <h3>Binnie Street Nursery – August 2016 to June 2017</h3>
 <p>In college I was given a nursery placement two days a week as part of my course. The
nursery was a very caring and nurturing environment, very similar to my placement last year
in a primary school. I enjoyed this placement as part of my studies thoroughly and everyday
was different.</p>

<h2><u>Extra-Curricular Activities</u></h2>

 <h3>The Recruit Programme</h3>
 <p>During the summer of 2016, I was given the opportunity to work with The Recruit. This is a
youth development programme that helps young people gain confidence and experience for
their futures. I had the chance to work with different companies around Scotland. This was an
amazing opportunity for me to meet new people and develop my confidence. This lasted
Monday to Friday every week for the whole summer and I was given a volunteering award at
the end of the programme.</p>

<h3>Duke of Edinburgh</h3> 
 <p>Over the past few years I have received my bronze and silver Duke of Edinburgh awards.
This has been an exciting experience for me as not many people participate in this
programme in my area. This experience was something that I will always be able to
remember. During these stays, I learned how to read a map and take part in a team. I also
cooked meals on a small stove and learned how to put up a tent. Teamwork is something that
I'm good at. I love working in a team, solving problems and taking on new challenges. The
Duke of Edinburgh programme is all about undertaking new challenges and I think this is
why I succeeded. Along with these stays, I volunteered for a year as part of the programme. I
looked after a young child for a friend and enjoyed it a lot at the time. I also played
badminton in a club for a year and learned how to play the guitar.</p>
 
<h3>British Sign Language</h3>
 <p>Learning BSL (British Sign Language) was a great opportunity for me to both learn a new
language and also to be able to talk to deaf people. This is an amazing skill to have as not
many people are able to communicate with those that are deaf. I have used this skill to sign to
deaf people I have met.</h3>
